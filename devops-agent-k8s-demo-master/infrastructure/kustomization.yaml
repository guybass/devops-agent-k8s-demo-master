# Deploys foundational infrastructure components:
#   1. External Secrets Operator - Syncs secrets from AWS Secrets Manager
#   2. AWS Load Balancer Controller - Manages ALB/NLB for Ingress and Services
#
# These are prerequisites for the application workloads.
# Can be deployed standalone: kubectl apply -k infrastructure/
